# Angular App Overview

## Purpose
This Angular application helps users improve their scripts by providing a cleaned version and a hook line, both generated by the backend. It also organizes the script into different scenes, which are listed for the user to review and process.

## Workflow
1. **User Input**: The user enters the original script in the app.
2. **Backend Processing**:
   - The backend returns:
     - `title`: Title of the script
     - `cleanedScript`: Improved/cleaned version of the original script
     - `hookLine`: A catchy hook line for the script
     - `scenes`: A list of scenes generated from the script
3. **Scene Listing**: The app displays the list of scenes for the user to review and process.
4. **Saving Data**: After processing, the app sends the finalized script and scenes data to the backend for saving in the database.

## Data Flow
- **Frontend (Angular)**: Handles user input, displays processed data, and manages scene listing.
- **Backend (.NET)**: Processes the script, generates cleaned script, hook line, and scenes, and saves data to the SQLite database.

## Key Features
- Script improvement and cleaning
- Hook line generation
- Scene extraction and listing
- Data persistence via backend
